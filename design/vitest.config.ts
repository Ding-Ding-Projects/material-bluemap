     * that ships. Vitest needs the SFC transform to compile the real one.
     *
     * Additive on purpose: the plugin only touches `.vue` files, so every existing test
     * runs exactly as before, and a test that wants a DOM opts into one per file with a
     * `@vitest-environment jsdom` docblock rather than the whole suite paying for it.
